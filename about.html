            During World War I, over 1.4 million Indian soldiers and 650,000
            Canadian soldiers served, with many fighting side by side on the
            Western Front. Indian soldiers arrived in Europe in 1914 and played
            a crucial role in key battles like Ypres, Neuve Chapelle, the Somme,
            and Vimy Ridge. The memorial aims to honor their sacrifices and
            highlight the forgotten story of their collaboration.

                Completed in May 2018 for the WWI Centennial, the Living Guard
                of Honour was the first step in commemorating the bravery of
                Indian and Canadian soldiers who fought side by side. This phase
                introduced a ceremonial space featuring symbolic elements that
                reflect the unity and sacrifice of these soldiers. The Living
                Guard of Honour consists of a formation of trees representing
                the enduring bond between the two nations, symbolizing strength,
                resilience, and remembrance.

                The trees stand tall like soldiers on the battlefield,
                representing those who never returned home. Each tree is
                dedicated to a regiment or battalion that played a crucial role
                in World War I. The space also includes plaques with
                inscriptions that tell the story of the soldiers’ struggles,
                courage, and contributions. The unveiling ceremony in 2018 was
                attended by veterans, historians, and families of the fallen,
                ensuring that their memories live on for future generations.

                November 11, 2026, will feature a Granite Rock Memorial with

                Chapelle, the Somme, and Vimy Ridge, where Indian and Canadian

                The memorial will serve as a lasting tribute, etched in stone,
                to remind visitors of the soldiers' hardships and sacrifices.
                The battlefield carvings will be created by skilled artisans who
                will ensure that every detail—from the expressions of the
                soldiers to the chaotic yet courageous battle scenes—captures
                the essence of war.

              <p>
                Additionally, the Granite Rock Memorial will have an interactive
                digital display, allowing visitors to learn about individual
                soldiers’ stories, the history of each regiment, and personal
                letters written from the frontlines. This will create an
                immersive and educational experience, ensuring that the
                sacrifices made over a century ago are never forgotten.

            <li>
              Recognizing the 135,000+ Indian soldiers who fought alongside
              Canadians: The memorial serves as a tribute to the Indian soldiers
              who fought shoulder to shoulder with Canadian forces during World
              War I. Their contributions, courage, and resilience on the
              battlefield played a vital role in key battles, yet their stories
              have often been overlooked in mainstream historical narratives. By
              recognizing their service, the memorial aims to bring their
              sacrifices into the public consciousness and ensure they receive
              the respect and remembrance they deserve.
            </li>
            <li>
              Preserving stories of bravery and sacrifice: Many Indian and
              Canadian soldiers displayed extraordinary bravery, enduring harsh
              conditions, intense combat, and significant hardships in their
              pursuit of freedom and peace. This memorial will safeguard their
              stories, ensuring that their heroism is not forgotten. Through
              historical records, personal accounts, and visual storytelling, it
              will serve as a permanent space where future generations can learn
              about the immense sacrifices made on the battlefield.

            <li>
              Educating the public on this lesser-known chapter of history: The
              collaboration between Indian and Canadian soldiers in World War I
              remains an underrepresented part of military history. This
              memorial seeks to bridge that gap by providing educational
              resources, historical insights, and engaging narratives that
              highlight the significance of their contributions. Schools,
              researchers, and visitors will have access to a wealth of
              information, fostering a deeper appreciation of the shared history
              and values that bind Canada and India.
